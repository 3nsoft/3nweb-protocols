	<h1>ASMail (Authenticated Secure Mail)</h1>

	<p>To run this demo application, do the following service setup
		steps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://localhost:8080/mailerid-users/"
			target="_blank"> Create some test user identities</a>. These are used
			in authentication steps, which are done both by server, and by client
			sides. Identity verification should be done in a non-tracking
			fashion. Mozilla's BrowserID accomplishes just that within a browser.
			We liberate from browser's origins best protocol's aspects, placing
			them into our MailerId protocol, which is used for identities.</li>
		<li><a href="https://localhost:8080/asmail-users/"
			target="_blank"> Create account(s) in ASMail server for
				recipient(s)</a>. ASMail server only serves a role of an always
			reachable inbox, and a source of recipient's initial public key (in
			the absence of an off-line introduction). Sender's client talks
			directly with recipient's server. Therefore, ASMail server only knows
			that its user gets messages, but cannot know to whom user sends
			messages.</li>
		<li><a href="https://localhost:8080/3nstorage-users/"
			target="_blank"> Create account(s) in 3NStorage server for all
				users</a>. All messages are encrypted with short-lived keys. Each
			sender-recipient pair has its own keys. This creates a requirement to
			have a key management based on some storage. For some
			implementations, such storage can/must be local. But for an everyday
			common use of multiple synchronized devices, we need an online
			storage service, which adheres to the principles of 3N (<em>when
				there is No unencrypted data, when there is No unnecessary metadata,
				then there is Nothing to steal from the server</em>).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		<a href="asmail/app.html" target="_blank">Open ASMail demo app</a>.
		<br>
		Note that app's html+js doesnot have to be served from a server.
		It is meant and it will run from a local filesystem, subject to
		your browser's settings.
		But now, we serve it here from the server only for the sake of
		simplicity.
