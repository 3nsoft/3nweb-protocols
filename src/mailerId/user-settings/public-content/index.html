<h1>MailerId test users</h1>

<div id="start-view" style="display: none;">

	<p>MailerId provides an identity, like
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Persona/Protocol_Overview"
target="_blank">Mozilla's BrowserID protocol does</a>.
Identity provider certifies user's short lived key, and a third party verifies
user's key cryptographically. This establishes a trust between an identity and a third
party, based on a pre-existing trust, between the user and her identity provider.</p>
	<p>In BrowserID protocol, user, confirming her pre-existing relationship,
verifies herself to identity provider via password, entered on provider's special page.
In MailerId, pre-existing relationship is confirmed cryptographically, similarly to
SSH key-based authentication. This mechanism we call Public Key Login.</p>
	<p>Public Key Login (PKL for short) can be used instead of simple password-based
login on any site. This page, besides making demo setup, illustrates how PKL works.</p>
	
	<button onclick="openView('new-account-view')">Make New Account</button>
	<button onclick="openView('login-view')">Login into Existing Account</button>

</div>

<div id="new-account-view" style="display: none;">

<h2>Create new account in a test MailerId service @localhost</h2>

<form id="new-account-form" onsubmit="processNewUserInfoAndSend(this); return false;">

<p>
User must make up a username:<br>
<input name="username" type="text"><br>
and server will make sure, that it is unique (as usual).
</p>

<p>
User should provide to the server 32-byte (256-bit) public key, created from
some secret 32-byte key by <a href="http://nacl.cr.yp.to/box.html">NaCl's
crypto_box_keypair(secret_key) function</a>, or compatible implementation,
<a href="https://github.com/cubicbase/ecma-nacl">
Ecma-NaCl's box.generate_pubkey(secret_key)</a><br>
Enter public key in hex form without spaces:<br>
<input name="pubkey" type="text" maxlength="64" style="width: 48em;"><br>
Alternatively, the site's page/app may have a capability to derive secret key from
some password, generate public key, and give it to server at this signin moment.
Later on, client apps/pages would have to implement the same generation process, so
as to have proper secret key, corresponding to the public key on file in server.<br>
Enter passphrase with any characters you can type:<br>
<input name="pass" type="password" style="width: 48em;"><br>
Notice how server side of Public Key Login, and MailerId, does not distinguish between
password-generated, and randomly generated keys.
The former option allows for a simple style of password-based protection, while the later
option allows for strong randomly generated keys, which are mostly used in high-level
security departments.
