	<h1>Configuring ASMail test account.</h1>

	<div id="mid-login" style="display: none;">

		<h2>Sign in</h2>

		<p>
			With ASMail protocol, any server, located at any domain may service
			users with any address. For example, server <em>mail.provider.net</em>
			may be set in DNS record of <em>perfect.com</em> as providing ASMail
			service for all addresses <em>@perfect.com</em>. At the same time,
			some <em>users@perfect.com</em> may tell some of their correspondents
			to use server located at a totally different domain, <em>paranoidly.secure.net</em>.
			In this later case, <em>users@perfect.com</em> would have to set
			accounts for themselves at <em>paranoidly.secure.net</em>. This may
			be done by signin with passwords, or using Public Key Login, both of
			which require <em>users@perfect.com</em> to use yet another set of
			passwords/keys. To mitigate this issue without compromising privacy,
			login into <em>paranoidly.secure.net</em> can be done via MailerId
			protocol, which, due to its non-tracking properties, will not leak to
			identity provider for <em>perfect.com</em> that some of its users are
			using <em>paranoidly.secure.net</em>.
		</p>

		<p>This ASMail test service is using MailerId process to sign in
			for viewing and configuring accounts. Follow process steps in process
			log below, and in a network activity inspector of your browser.</p>

		<form onsubmit="signinWithMailerId(this); return false;">
			Enter account address (e.g. bob@localhost):<br> <input
				name="address" type="email" style="width: 20em;"><br>
			Enter a passphrase:<br> <input name="pass" type="password"
				style="width: 20em;"><br>
			<button type="submit">Sign in</button>
		</form>
