	<h1>Creating 3NStorage test account.</h1>

	<div id="mid-login" style="display: none;">

		<h2>Sign in</h2>

		<p>
			With 3NStorage protocol, any server, located at any domain may
			service users with any address. For example, server <em>store.provider.net</em>
			may be set in DNS record of <em>perfect.com</em> as providing
			3NStorage service for all addresses <em>@perfect.com</em>. At the
			same time, some <em>users@perfect.com</em> may use server located at
			a totally different domain, <em>paranoidly.secure.net</em>. In this
			later case, <em>users@perfect.com</em> would have to set accounts for
			themselves at <em>paranoidly.secure.net</em>. This may be done by
			signin with passwords, or using Public Key Login, both of which
			require <em>users@perfect.com</em> to use yet another set of
			passwords/keys. To mitigate this issue without compromising privacy,
			login into <em>paranoidly.secure.net</em> can be done via MailerId
			protocol, which, due to its non-tracking properties, will not leak to
			identity provider for <em>perfect.com</em> that some of its users are
			using <em>paranoidly.secure.net</em>.
		</p>

		<p>This 3NStorage test service is using MailerId process to sign
			in for creating accounts. Follow process steps in process log below,
			and in a network activity inspector of your browser.</p>
